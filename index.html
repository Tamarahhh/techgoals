      <h1>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h1>
      <div id="goals">
        <p>
          On my journey to become a full stack web developer, I plan on
          mastering one stack at a time. Over the next two years, I'll focus on
          improving my frontend skills and gradually incorporating backend
          technologies. Below is an outline of my goals for the next 2 years in
          the tech field.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Enhance Frontend Skills:</strong>
          First, I want to enhance my frontend skills. Mastering HTML and CSS is
          crucial for creating advanced, flexible web designs. I'll explore
          advanced techniques like Flexbox and Grid layouts and deepen my
          understanding of JavaScript and frameworks like React. By focusing on
          React, I'll learn to create dynamic applications using hooks, the
          context API, and state management solutions like Redux.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Improve UI/UX Design Skills:</strong>
          I also need to improve my UI/UX design skills. I'll learn tools like
          Figma and Sketch to create intuitive, visually appealing interfaces.
          Ensuring that all my projects are fully responsive is a priority,
          using the latest CSS techniques and frameworks for seamless
          experiences across all platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Optimize Web Performance:</strong>
          Optimizing web performance is another key focus. I'll use techniques
          like lazy loading, code splitting, and image optimization to improve
          application performance. Efficient debugging and automated testing
          with tools like Jest and React Testing Library will help maintain code
          quality and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Master Version Control:</strong>
          Mastering version control with Git is essential for collaboration and
          code management. I'll improve my branching, merging, and pull request
          management skills. Participating in open-source projects and coding
          communities will enhance my collaboration skills and allow me to learn
          from others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Learn Backend Technologies:</strong>
          As I gain confidence in my frontend skills, I'll gradually learn
          backend technologies. Understanding server-side programming,
          databases, and APIs will be crucial for my transition to full stack
          development. This knowledge will enable me to integrate frontend
          applications with backend services smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Build a Portfolio:</strong>
          Building a solid portfolio is important to showcase my progress and
          abilities as a developer. I'll create a variety of projects, from
          personal initiatives to collaborative efforts, to demonstrate my
          ability to tackle new challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Improve Soft Skills:</strong>
          Improving my soft skills, like communication, problem-solving, and
          project management, is also vital. These skills are essential for
          effective collaboration in team settings and managing complex tasks.
          I'm confident that by working towards these goals, I'll become a
          professional full stack web developer within the next two years,
          starting with frontend technologies and then mastering backend
          development.
